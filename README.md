Anivia
======

Anivia is a highly scalable, resilient, and modern IRCd. Unfortunately, Anivia is a work in progress and is not yet suitable for being built or yet capable of functioning as an IRCd. As this project becomes closer to completion, however, this file will be updated with more information and the resources necessary for you to deploy and contribute to Anivia.
